		<h1>Process</h1>
		<h2>Welcome to the process page!</h2>
		<p>This page is kind of like a glossary. All the terms, processes and modes of presenting and documenting information can be found on this page. I have catalogged them and given short explainations from what I have learnt so far. Examples of these processes can be found in the documents page, and links are to found throughout. It also contains an overview of my growth through the first semester.</p>

	  		<h3>Moodboard</h3>
    		<p>Like a brainstorm in color. In other words after collecting information on the client and the project, the designer alows all of these impressions and directions to create a collage of color and images which will set the ground work for mockups and style-tiles to come. Its important to give weight to this process in order to get a design direction as early on as possible to save unnecessary iterations.</p>

	  		<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
    		<p>This process actually incorperates several other processes that make up the construction of information about the project. 
			</p>
			Creative brief – I use a ten point list as a template, for all my projects. Basically this brief breaks down the project from the point of the clients wishes, competitors, technical limitations and deadlines, as well as several other points. 
			<p>Card-sorting and other user test – An open sort, is a group of at least 30 cards, up to a 100 or more, depending on the site. Each card presents a task which could be solved on the website in question. The user is asked to sort the cards in groups according to his/her logic. The groups should contain between 5 and 15 cards optimally. Finally the user is asked to add a titel, again acording to their own logic, to each group of cards. Continued...</p>

			<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
			<p>Continued...</p>
	  		<p>This gives an insight into the search and find pattern of the individual user, and get help the designer develope more intuitive information structure.</p>
			<p>Product breakdown structure – This is a process of breaking down the project into its parts. The purpose of this is to get a grip on the necessary steps in order to achieve the project goal.</p>
			<p>Work breakdown structure – Comes after Product breakdown structure, as it is the process of putting time limits on the individual parts found in the PBS. This gives an overall time span of the project, as well as giving the designer an idea of which parts can realistically be achieved within the deadline.</p>

	  		<h3>Mockups</h3>
    		<p>A further developement on the Moodboard, a non interactive visual contruction of the site is created to get an idea of the visual design. Mockups are important in order to be able to decide whether colors and structure play well together on a page.</p>
  		</div>
  		<div class="process"> 
	  		<h3>Site-map</h3>
			<p>This process gives the designer a birds eye view of the map of the site. How many pages are there, and how should they relate to each other. The initial card sorting exercise can give a designer a good starting point to decide on page titles and page placement, and  help deliver a better site structure.</p>

	  		<h3>Style-tile</h3>
    		<p>When speaking of the graphical or visual representation of the website, the style-tile is the final process before prototype developement. Fontssize and weight as well as color palettes are added to a mackup and used to cement the final design decisions and guide other members of the team working individually within their speciality.</p>

		<div class="process"> 
	  		<h3>Wire-frames</h3>
    		<p>By sketching a framework for the page this tool helps the designer – before adding color and fonts – to make choices about the layout of the webpage. Grids can be used to create balance and structure which is pleasing to the eye. Image placeholders are used to determin columnm width and height. This is an invalueble tool in creating a balnced website and give the team-members coding the final site a good blueprint to follow.</p>

	  		<h3>Flowchart</h3>
    		<p>This is a continuation of the sitemap. Similar in its simplicity, but with the added benifit of an element of interactivity. A flowchart will explore a users path to certain points within a site. Which pages must a user pass through in order to achieve their goal. Of course the shortest and most intuitive path to information is in this profession always the best! </p>

	  		<h3>Prototype</h3>
    		<p>The final push before the finished site can be crafted. The prototype is the perfect tool for user testing, as it is as close to a functional fished product as you can get. Adobe XD is for example a good prototyping tool, in whicg interactivty can be fained without actually using time coding an online product. It can be sent to user through an online link, and feedback can be collected so final changes can be made to the designs and structure before final creation.</p>

		<h3>Tips &amp; tricks</h3>
    	<p>This is where you find tips and trick from the business! All the processes of designing a website have a chronological order, but they are repeated sometimes several times as new information and design decision are made during developement. This creates a circular motion, or iterations of the individual processes. A website in not stationary product but an organic entity, which developes and improves over time!</p>
