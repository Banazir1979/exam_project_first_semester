	  		<h3>Moodboard</h3>
    		<p>Like a brainstorm in color. In other words after collecting information on the client and the project, the designer alows all of these impressions and directions to create a collage of color and images which will set the ground work for mockups and style-tiles to come. Its important to give weight to this process in order to get a design direction as early on as possible to save unnecessary iterations.</p>

	  		<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
    		<p>This process actually incorperates several other processes that make up the construction of information about the project. 
			</p>
			Creative brief – I use a ten point list as a template, for all my projects. Basically this brief breaks down the project from the point of the clients wishes, competitors, technical limitations and deadlines, as well as several other points. 
			<p>Card-sorting and other user test – An open sort, is a group of at least 30 cards, up to a 100 or more, depending on the site. Each card presents a task which could be solved on the website in question. The user is asked to sort the cards in groups according to his/her logic. The groups should contain between 5 and 15 cards optimally. Finally the user is asked to add a titel, again acording to their own logic, to each group of cards.</p>

	  		<p>This gives an insight into the search and find pattern of the individual user, and get help the designer develope more intuitive information structure.</p>
			<p>Product breakdown structure – This is a process of breaking down the project into its parts. The purpose of this is to get a grip on the necessary steps in order to achieve the project goal.</p>
			<p>Work breakdown structure – Comes after Product breakdown structure, as it is the process of putting time limits on the individual parts found in the PBS. This gives an overall time span of the project, as well as giving the designer an idea of which parts can realistically be achieved within the deadline.</p>

    	<p>This is where you find tips and trick from the business! Did you know that CSS Flex attribute alows you to orginize boxes within a container in all kinds of different orientations! Previously possitioning was done in realtion to paretn elements, or in absolute realtion to the viewport.</p>
