			<h3>Girl on bridge</h3>
    		<p>The first project of 2018 was taking pictures of bridges. I was sidetailed when I noticed this girl, herself taking pictures of bridges. Later during expieriments with photoshop I tweeked the colors. I am fascinated with B &amp; W images mixed with splurges of contrast color. </p>

			<h3>Copywrite</h3>
    		<p>Begining September 2018 we were schooled on copywrite law. Goal was to take an image that was clearly copywrited and tweak it enough in order to nullify the copywrite law due to artistic liberties. I took two copywrited images, one of Gearge Bush and the other of a posed corpse from the <q>body gallery</q>. I merged the two, and judged that they were so different from the original that I was safe from copywrite infringement.</p>

		<h3>Tips &amp; Tricks</h3>
    	<p>Picking the right font or text style is an important part of the design process for many designers. Legibility, which is the ability to regognize individual charecters in a text, and readablity which is the ease at which one can understand a text, are closely realted to the right chocie of font and fontsize. Things like kerning, and lineheight can be tweeked in an exsiting font to ease both readability and legibilty. </p>
