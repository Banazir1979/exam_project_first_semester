			<p class="column">The portfolio project has spans over the course of the first semester, and was split into three parts. In the beginning of the semester we were asked to use our recently aquired knowledge of Adobe Xd, and create a prototype of our ideal portfolio.There was no user testing and little information architecture at this early stage, and the purpose was to introduce us to the idea of this work portfolio.</p>

			<p class="column">Second section of the portfolio process came after initial CSS and Html studies. The goal was now to incorperate these skills in an online version of portfolio we had dreamt up, in an earlier project. This was an interesting process, as my skills in coding an online solution were somewhat lacking in comparison to what I had dreamt up earlier. I also used expierience from a previous part of the course, to create some icons for the protfolio, using Adobe illustrator.</p>

			<div class="column">
			  <p>This is the current version of the portfolio, and what you are looking at right now. Let me walk you through the process. User testing of the original Portfolio was performed in order to narrow in on its faults. The user was one Daniel Jensen, and  is what he pointed out for each page. I also asked him to do an open card sort, with about 25 tasks I had created for a fictional website.</p>
			  <p>The next step was a brainstorm of the project which led on to a moodboard. These two items I gave myself a short time to do, in order to keep the flow fresh and inspired. The colors from my moodboard have been incorperated in the final design, as well as several ideas I had from my brainstorm. I analysed the results of the user test, and also tried to respect these observations, while planning the next step.</p>
				<p>I brokedown the steps that I saw as necsessary to complete this project. this process is known as Product Breakdown Structure. Once I had completed this on paper I plotted it into a diagram, that I could use for reference. I used the breakdown to plan the time I would have to put aside to create this portfolio. This is called making a Work Breakdown Structure. I plotted this into an excel sheet, and also commited it to memory in order to keep myself on track chronologically.</p>
				<p>I then sat down and created wireframes and a sitemap for the portfolio. I used pencil and paper, in order to focus on the design process and not get bogged down with tech issues. I drew a sketch of all pages, in all three sizes that I wanted to represent. Mobile, Tablet and Desktop.</p>
				<p>Once these sketches were in place I documented them, for later use, and them I used their design, for making a mockup, which in this case was one page in which I still in pencil measured and marked the beginings of HTML and CSS box creation so that I could have a template to start my coding on later. I also used colered pencils on this template in order to create a styletile, which also documents the colors I wanted to use, in RGB and Hex-code. For the color scheme I was inspired by the Ghanaian national flag. The country my grandfather comes from.</p>
				<p>Once the mockup and styletile where in place, I was ready to embark on coding the venture. So far I was on schedual</p>

		<h3>Tips &amp; tricks</h3>
    	<p>This is where you find tips and trick from the business! All the processes of designing a website have a chronological order, but they are repeated sometimes several times as new information and design decision are made during developement. This creates a circular motion, or iterations of the individual processes. A website in not stationary product but an organic entity, which developes and improves over time!</p>
