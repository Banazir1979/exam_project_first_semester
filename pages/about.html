		<h4>About the author</h4>
		<p>My name is Nicholas Schjaerff, a 39 year old man, who has tried a bunch of stuff throughout my life. I was born in Nairobi, Kenya, spent the next 9 years in San Fransisco, New York and Vancouver, because of my fathers job. The family came to Denmark in the early 90's, and I have been living here since. That is aside from a few adventures in Norway, Spain and Brazil, where I spent a year each, working different jobs.</p>
		<p>I used to love to draw growing up. Drawing and hiking in nature, were the two ways for me to meditate while awake. Coming into adolescence, stopped my two favorite pass times, and I focused on school and social endevours</p>
		<p>I worked different jobs throughout my early adulthood, mostly focusing on getting paid, so that I could travel more. At past thirty I started as an appentice mechanic for Audi Automobiles, and ended up there – later becoming a full blown mechanic – for 8 years. Back problems and a feeling of being in the wrong place in my life finally convinced me to reevaluate my life choices. </p>
		<p>Which brings me to now. Almost through the first semster of Multimedia design, at Cph-business in Lyngby. People who know me as a mechanic might see it as a weird change of direction, but it feels right to me. Like I am coming back to one of my two favourite things to do when I was a kid.</p>

		<h4>Freetime</h4>
		<p>In my free time I like to ocean swim and bikeride – in the summer of course – as well as going for walks and reading. I love music, of all types, but mostly R &amp; B and Hip-Hop, peppered with some trance and classical when I´m in the mood.I live alone north of Copenhagen, in my own place. Away from the hustle and bustle of the inner city. I have my mother and younger brother close by. My father lives in Brazil, and has done for over twenty years now.</p>

	<h3>Tips &amp; Tricks</h3>
    <p>CSS is an important part of creating an online website. Along side HTML and Java script, it makes up the columns which hold the structure of web information. Here are some interesting facts about CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files </p>
